Remotely connecting: First step, open  terminal in the Visual Studio(control+`) then type 
$ ssh cs15lfa22@zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Don’t forget to replace “zz” with your actual account number. If this is your first time connecting to the remote server, you might get a message. Just type “yes” to this message and give your password then you will connect to the remoter sever.

Trying Some Commands: Try running different commands both on your computer and on the remote sever. For example: ls, pwd, and cat. For example, I  printed out the working directory by typing “pwd”.
